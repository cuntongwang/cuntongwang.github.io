_Freedom through truth for service_—originally the motto of Yenching University, and now the guiding principle behind my dedication to social welfare.

As a demographer and an advocate for public service, I firmly believe every individual’s life journey deserves attention. Over the years, I have employed personal volunteering, big data analysis, and empirical research to illuminate social inequalities and structural imbalances. Collaborating with various nonprofit organizations and community groups, I strive to promote inclusive social support and educational initiatives, with special focus on youth, women, older adults, and individuals with disabilities.

I am convinced that only by merging data-driven insights with genuine compassion can we truly provide effective assistance to vulnerable populations. I look forward to working alongside like-minded partners to ensure those in need receive the support they deserve. If you are interested in these projects or wish to get involved, please feel free to reach out at any time.

**个人使命与理念**
因真理，得自由，以服务（Freedom Through Truth For Service）。这是原燕京大学的校训，更是我致力于社会公益服务的座右铭。

作为一名人口学家，也是一位社会公益的践行者，我深信每个人的生命轨迹都值得被关注。多年来，我通过个人服务、大数据分析与实证研究，致力于揭示社会不平等和社会结构失衡的问题，并与各类公益组织和社区团体通力合作，推动面向所有群体的社会支持与教育项目，特别关注青少年、女性、老年人口及残疾群体。

我相信，唯有将数据与人文关怀相结合，才能真正实现对弱势群体的精准帮助。我也期待与更多志同道合的伙伴携手，让那些亟需关注的人群获得应有的支持。如果您对相关项目感兴趣，或希望一起参与，欢迎随时与我联系。
